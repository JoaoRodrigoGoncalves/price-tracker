# Price Checker (Tracker) whatever you want to call it
A platform to follow prices of products on some Portuguese tech stores

Once again, one of my old projects.
I do not have the database or the cron script anymore.

Feel free to do whatever you want with it.

# Some explanation

The status.txt file was updated via cron script every time it connected to the stores' website to update the prices;
The cronCheckPrices.php is the file that is run by the cron script (is essentially the same as the checkPrices.php but slightly changed)

The interface is in Portuguese, almost all code is commented in English.
